üí° **TL;DR**: Rugix is a suite of open-source tools to **build and deploy reliable embedded Linux devices at scale with efficient and secure over-the-air (OTA) update capabilities**.
Companies around the world use Rugix as a basis for their connected products.
Currently, the tool suite consists of two main tools:

- **Rugix Ctrl**: On-device tool for installing over-the-air updates and managing state.
- **Rugix Bakery**: Flexible, user-friendly build system for bespoke Linux distributions.

While these tools are designed two work seamlessly together, **they can be used independently**.
By providing a unified and efficient modern development workflow, **Rugix enables better results at a lower cost**.
If you prefer [Yocto](https://www.yoctoproject.org) over Rugix Bakery, we also provide open-source [Yocto layers for Rugix](https://github.com/silitics/meta-rugix/).

## Rugix Ctrl: The Update Mechanism

Rugix Ctrl has all features you would expect from a state-of-the-art update solution and more:

- **Atomic A/B system updates** with popular bootloaders out of the box.
- **Streaming updates** as well as [**best-in-class delta updates**](https://rugix.org/blog/efficient-delta-updates) out of the box.
- Builtin **cryptographic integrity verification** _before_ installing anything anywhere.
- Supports **any update scenario**, including **non-A/B updates and incremental updates**.
- Supports **any bootloader and boot process** through [custom _boot flows_](https://rugix.org/docs/ctrl/advanced/boot-flows).
- **Robust state management mechanism** inspired by container-based architectures.
- Integrates well with [different fleet management solutions](https://rugix.org/docs/ctrl/advanced/fleet-management) (avoids vendor lock-in).
- Provides powerful interfaces to built your own update workflow upon.
- Open-source [Yocto layers](https://github.com/silitics/meta-rugix/) for seamless Rugix integration.

Rugix Ctrl **supports or can be adapted to almost any requirements you may have** when it comes to robust and secure updates of your entire system as well as its individual components.

## Rugix Bakery: The Development Tool

You wrote your application and now need to integrate it into a full system ready to be flashed onto your device or deployed as an update?
Rugix Bakery makes this process (almost) **as easy as writing a Dockerfile, enabling you to focus on what provides value to your users** instead of system-level details.

- Build upon proven distributions such as **Debian and Alpine Linux**.
- **Over-the-air update capabilities** powered by Rugix Ctrl out of the box.
- Build everything **from source to image in a container-based environment**.
- Define **multiple system variants**, including variants for testing.
- Builtin **system testing framework** and **support for running VMs**.

With Rugix Bakery, you get a **comprehensive tool to build, test, and run your system** similar to what you will find with modern software development tooling, like [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/) (Rust) or [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (Python).

## Why Rugix?

While there are already plenty of tools for building images, updating systems, and managing state in the embedded Linux ecosystem, integrating them into a robust, coherent solution remains a significant challenge.
With Rugix, we aim to **simplify the development of embedded Linux devices by providing a unified, modern suite of tools that seamlessly integrate** to provide an efficient workflow for building, updating, and managing embedded Linux systems at scale.
We believe that **building embedded Linux devices should not be as complicated as it often is today**.

While simplicity is our first key tenet, our second is to **provide solutions that are absolutely robust**.
Embedded devices must stay operational no matter what, always, anywhere.
With Rugix, we **make it easy to follow best practices** for building reliable devices, like read-only system partitions, fully atomic updates with on-device validation, and declarative, ideally fully reproducible builds.
