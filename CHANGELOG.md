# Changelog

## Unreleased

Nix integration:

- Export `nixosModules.rugix` for Rugix Ctrl services, daemon configuration, and app recovery.
- Export `lib.mkBundle` for packaging caller-supplied payloads with a Rugix bundle manifest.

Rugix Bundler:

- Add `docker-archive` Compose image sources for bundling prebuilt images without a registry or container daemon. Archive paths resolve relative to the Compose file, and normal content-based pinning applies.
- Export `lib.mkComposeBundle` from the Nix flake to package Nix-built container images, Compose configuration, and app metadata.
- Honor the caller's temporary directory when Skopeo stages container images, including inside Nix build sandboxes.

Rugix Ctrl:

- Add the `rugix.init.quiet` kernel command-line option to suppress routine early-boot output while retaining errors.

## Version 1.3.0

Behavior Changes:

- Rugix Admin now has its own repository, installer, and release artifacts. It is no longer built or distributed from the Rugix Ctrl repository.
- Data partition mount failures now fall back to ephemeral state by default. Set `data-partition.fail-on-mount-error = true` when booting without persistent data must fail.

Security and Reliability:

- Harden bundle parsing with strict framing, bounded reads, compressed-block metadata validation, and error propagation for malformed or truncated input.
- Accept bundle signatures from any configured certificate root, broaden CMS signature interoperability, and continue checking other signatures and roots when one candidate is invalid.
- Confine bundle, application, and persistent-state paths; validate application archives before extraction; and reject unsafe names, traversal paths, and symlinked application-file destinations.
- Write bundles atomically, preserve update state across synchronization failures, synchronize payloads before completion, and retain deferred reboot targets.
- Make multi-application activation transactional, recover interrupted application updates, and report rolled-back or failed activations as failures.
- Validate generic, Mender, RAUC, and systemd boot-flow state mappings and preserve GPT and partition metadata when modifying disks.
- Replace remaining panic paths in bundle decoding, update installation, simulation, boot-flow handling, and application service management with reported errors.

Rugix Ctrl:

- Add an internal Unix-socket daemon mode that lets unprivileged Rugix Ctrl clients execute typed status, installation, system, and application operations through a privileged process. Destructive system and application lifecycle operation families require explicit daemon feature flags, and `rugix-ctrl daemon info` reports the daemon's effective policy.
- Detect the active boot group through transitive backing devices for device-mapper system roots.
- Log Rugix init errors that were previously ignored or only printed to stderr.
- Add opt-in `rugix.init.shell_on_error[=<seconds>]` kernel cmdline option for opening a debug shell after init errors. This is intentionally disabled by default to avoid exposing a root shell to someone with console access.
- Add `overlay-fallback: in-memory` state configuration to retry root overlay setup with an in-memory overlay when the configured overlay fails.
- Add boot flow capability reporting for userspace failure recovery and fall back to starting the underlying init on committed systems when Rugix init fails and the boot flow cannot recover userspace failures.
- Write Docker Compose activation diagnostics, including service status and recent logs, when bringing up a Rugix App generation fails.
- Add experimental component compatibility metadata discovery and `rugix-ctrl components` inspection commands for checking installed system, local, runtime, app, and synthetic host components.
- Check component compatibility before installing system updates, installing apps, or removing apps. Pass `--skip-compatibility-check` to bypass these checks.

Rugix Bundler:

- Rework Docker Compose image bundling to copy images with Skopeo, infer Compose `build:` entries, default local builds to Podman, and rewrite packaged Compose files to Rugix-owned bundle-local image tags. `--disable-pinning` now keeps the original Compose image references while still bundling the images.
- Allow update bundles to carry declared component metadata for compatibility checks.

Libraries:

- Add `rugix-component-set` for evaluating component capabilities, requirements, and conflicts, and use the published `anyver`, `byte-calc`, and `reportify` crates.
- Refresh dependencies to resolve the `crossbeam-epoch` security advisory.

## Version 1.2.0

Behavior changes:

- Bundle installation now rejects bundles without a block index by default. Pass `--insecure-allow-missing-block-index` to install such bundles.

Rugix Ctrl:

- Add data partition drivers.
- Support for optional slots.
- Override active boot group detection via `rugix.boot_group=<name>` on the kernel cmdline.
- Add `reboot` operation to boot flow interface.
- Allow the bootstrap marker to be placed in `rugix` instead of `.rugix`.
- Resolve parents of virtual block devices.
- Acquire a write guard on the config partition for file slots that live there.
- Gracefully handle boot flow errors during init.
- Fix infinite loop when scanning for the parent of a block device.

Rugix Bundler:

- Annotate opaque types in the published bundle manifest JSON Schemas with their JSON representation.
- Honor `--disable-pinning` when saving container images.
- Leave locally-built container images unpinned instead of failing.
