# State Management Ideas

## (Planned) Exporting and Importing

**ðŸš§ This feature is planned but has not been implemented yet! ðŸš§**

Export all state and later import it.

```shell
rugix-ctrl state export <file name>.tar.xz
```

```shell
rugix-ctrl state import <file name>.tar.xz
```

## (Planned) State Profiles

**ðŸš§ This feature is planned but has not been implemented yet! ðŸš§**

Sometimes it can be beneficial to support multiple _profiles_ with different state.

```shell
rugix-ctrl state list
```

```shell
rugix-ctrl state create <profile name>
```

```shell
rugix-ctrl state switch <profile name>
```

## (Planned) Hardware Reset Button

**ðŸš§ This feature is planned but has not been implemented yet! ðŸš§**

Should a device hang in a boot loop or otherwise malfunction because of corrupted state, a hardware reset button may be a convenient way for users to reset a system in the field, without requiring an expensive service technician to come out or sending the device to a repair center.
For this purpose, Rugix Ctrl can be configured to check whether a reset button connected to one of the GPIO pins of the Raspberry Pi is pressed.
If this is the case and the button is hold for a specific amount of time, a factory reset can be automatically performed with the option to preserve the corrupted state for later (remote) recovery.
Likewise, another button could be programmed to initiate a reboot to the spare system, increasing the resiliency even further.
