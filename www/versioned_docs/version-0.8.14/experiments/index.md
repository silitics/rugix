**This part of the documentation is for experimental developments under the umbrella of the Rugix Project.** The things that are documented here are work-in-progress at best and failed, abandoned experiments at worst. As a regular Rugix user, **it is probably best to simply ignore this part of the documentation**. We typically explore, develop, and document ideas here first before stabilizing and transitioning them to other parts of the documentation.
