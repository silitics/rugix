# System Testing

Embedded Linux systems are inherently complex, with numerous interconnected components working together.
To ensure that all parts of a system work together seamlessly, Rugix Bakery includes a system testing framework designed to validate system images as a complete unit.
This framework boots a system image in a virtual machine and then executes a _test workflow_ on the system.
By catching integration errors early, it reduces the need for costly and time-consuming testing on physical hardware.

**Limitations:** Currently, the integration testing framework is limited to the `generic-grub-efi` target.

:::warning
This feature is experimental.
**We may introduce breaking changes to the configuration schema in minor versions.**
Currently, the testing functionality is rather rudimentary as we are still working on it.

## Test Workflows

Test workflows are placed in the `tests` directory of your Rugix Bakery project. Each workflow consists of a TOML file describing the tests to be conducted. To this end, the workflow file starts with a declaration of _test systems_:

```toml
[[systems]]
system = "<system-name>"
ssh = { private-key = "<path-to-private-key>" }
```

Each test system declaration must specify a `system`, which is the system to test.
In addition, a `disk-size` can be specified determining the size of the disk.
By default, Rugix Bakery will create a 40 GiB disk.
Note that Rugix Bakery allocates an image per system that grows on-demand and stores only the changes made over the original system image.
Hence, typically much less than `disk-space` additional space is required.
Multiple systems can be specified in the same test workflow.
Rugix will then run the workflow for each system.
**You must not build any images manually while running tests.**

To execute commands on the system under test, Rugix Bakery connects to the system running in the VM via SSH.
To this end, a private key needs to specified.
This private key must be placed somewhere in the project directory.
It is recommended to generate a pair of keys exclusively for this purpose and inject the public key with an additional layer on-top of the actual system layer.[^key-injection]
To generate a suitable pair of SSH keys in the current working directory, run:

[^key-injection]: In the future, Rugix Bakery may inject a key by itself prior to running the VM.

```shell
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -f id_rsa
```

We recommend generating the keys locally and putting them into a directory outside of version control.

If you want an example for how to set everything up, you can look at the system tests that we use to [test Rugix Ctrl](https://github.com/silitics/rugix/tree/main/tests).

The declaration of test systems is followed by a specification of _test steps_.

### Test Steps

Each test step performs a certain `action`. Currently, the following actions are supported:

- `wait`: Wait for some amount of time.
- `run`: Run a script via SSH in the VM.

#### Wait

The `wait` action takes a `duration` option specifying the time to wait in seconds. Here is an example for waiting 20 seconds:

```toml
[[steps]]
action = "wait"
duration = 20
```

#### Run

The `run` action takes a `script` option with a shell script to execute. For example:

```toml
[[steps]]
action = "run"
script = """
#!/bin/bash
echo "Hello from the VM."
"""
```

Note that the script needs a shebang, e.g., `#!/bin/bash`, to execute.

In addition, the `run` action supports the following optional options:

- `may-disconnect`: Sometimes, e.g., when rebooting the system with a script, the execution may fail because the SSH connection drops, however, this is expected and the test should not fail. In this case, you can set `may-disconnect` to `true` indicating that it is okay for the SSH connection to drop. Note that a non-zero exit code of the script will still fail the test.
- `may-fail`: Allows the script to fail with a non-zero exit code without failing the test.
- `stdin-file`: Path to a file which is provided as stdin to the script. Can be used to stream an update into the system.


## Running Tests

Tests can be run with the `test` command:

```shell
./run-bakery test
```
