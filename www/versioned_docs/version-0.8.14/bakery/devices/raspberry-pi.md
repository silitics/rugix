# Raspberry Pi

In principle, Rugix Bakery supports all Raspberry Pi models.

Here is an overview over all the supported Raspberry Pi models:

| Pi 5 | Pi 4 | Pi 3   | Pi 2 v1.2 | Pi 2  | Pi 1   | Pi Zero 2 | Pi Zero | CM 4 | CM 3  | CM 1   |
| ---- | ---- | ------ | --------- | ----- | ------ | --------- | ------- | ---- | ----- | ------ |
| ✅   | ✅   | ✅[^1]  | ✅[^1] | ❓[^1] | ✅[^1] | ✅[^1] | ✅[^1] | ✅ | ❓[^1] | ❓[^1] |

✅ fully supported, ❓ in principle supported but untested

[^1]: Requires the U-Boot boot flow.

**⚠️ Please also read the remarks for the respective boards below.**

Raspberry Pi OS releases based on Debian Bullseye and Bookworm are supported.

For 32-bit models and to build 32-bit images for 64-bit boards, you need to set the `architecture` for the respective system to:
```toml
architecture = "armhf"
```

To build 32-bit images, you also need to enable emulation of `armhf` in Docker:

```shell
docker run --privileged --rm tonistiigi/binfmt --install armhf
```

For `armhf`, note that the architecture reported by `uname -m` during the build process is `armv7l`, however, when running the image later on a non-ARMv7 board (e.g., Pi Zero or Pi 1), then the architecture will be `armv6l`.
Make sure that the binaries you install are compatible with the `armv6l` architecture, if you aim to deploy the image to these boards.

## Raspberry Pi 5

Updating the bootloader is not necessary for Raspberry Pi 5, as it already comes with the `tryboot` feature out-of-the-box.

## Raspberry Pi 4 and Compute Module 4

The bootloader version shipped with Raspberry Pi 4 and Compute Module 4 does not support the `tryboot` feature out-of-the-box.
To use Rugix Bakery with these boards, the bootloader stored in the EEPROM must be updated to at least version `2023-05-11`.
For Compute Module 4, this requires `usbboot` (see [CM4's documentation for details](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/compute-module.html#flashing-the-bootloader-eeprom-compute-module-4) or check out [this blog post by Jeff Geerling](https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2022/how-update-raspberry-pi-compute-module-4-bootloader-eeprom)).
For Raspberry Pi 4, you can use the `core/rpi-include-firmware` recipe to include the update in the image.
The bootloader will then be automatically updated when first booting the image.
Note that after the first boot, the automatic update will be disabled, i.e., you cannot take the SD card to another Raspberry Pi which does not yet have the update installed.
Note that the resulting image will be specific for Raspberry Pi 4, do not use it for any other models.

## Updating `cmdline.txt` and `config.txt`

If you are using the `tryboot` boot flow on a Raspberry Pi 4 or 5, you can also update the files `cmdline.txt` and `config.txt`.
Those files are placed by the respective core recipes in the following directory:

```
${RUGIX_LAYER_DIR}/roots/boot/
```

Have a look at the recipes [`rpi-debian-setup`](https://github.com/silitics/rugix/tree/main/bakery/repositories/core/recipes/rpi-debian-setup) and [`rpi-alpine-setup`](https://github.com/silitics/rugix/tree/main/bakery/repositories/core/recipes/rpi-alpine-setup) for details.
You can modify the files in the `roots/boot` directory with custom recipes.
For builds based on Raspberry Pi OS, Rugix Bakery will extract the boot partition to `roots/boot`.

## Other Models

For other models than Pi 5, Pi 4, Pi 400, and CM 4, you must use the `rpi-uboot` target.

**⚠️ The U-Boot boot flow is experimental and does not allow updating the Raspberry Pi bootloader/firmware.**

[^1]: To prevent the EEPROM from being updated on each boot.
