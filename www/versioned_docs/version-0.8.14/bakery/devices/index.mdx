# Supported Devices

Rugix Bakery can support a diverse range of devices.

When building a system with Rugix Bakery, you need to specify a *target* that is appropriate for your device.
Targets typically support a whole family of devices and are categorized into *generic*, *specific*, and *unknown* targets.
Generic targets are based on a standardized booting mechanism and support a wide range of devices.
Specific targets, on the other hand, are limited to a certain family of devices and unknown targets are for devices that are not specifically supported by Rugix Bakery.

For further details, we refer to the [documentation section on Systems](../systems.md).

Device support comes in three different tiers:

- ðŸ¥‡ **Tier 1**: Rugix is regularly tested on these devices and fully supports them.
- ðŸ¥ˆ **Tier 2**: Support for these devices is provided on a best-effort basis.
- ðŸ¥‰ **Tier 3**: These devices are supported but are rarely tested and not prioritized.

:::tip
As part of it's [enterprise offering](/commercial-support), Silitics offers ready-made support for more devices.
