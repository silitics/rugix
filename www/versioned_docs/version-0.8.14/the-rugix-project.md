# The Rugix Project

While there are already plenty of tools for building images, updating systems, and managing state in the embedded Linux ecosystem, integrating them into a robust, coherent solution remains a significant challenge.
The Rugix Project strives to **simplify the development of embedded Linux devices** by creating a unified, modern suite of tools that seamlessly integrate to provide a streamlined and efficient workflow for building, updating, and managing embedded Linux systems at scale.
While the tools are designed to work together seamlessly, you can also use them individually, if you like.
We believe that **building innovative devices shouldn't be as complicated as it often is today**.
By lowering the amount of required engineering resources, we aim to foster innovation while reducing costs.

While simplicity is our first key tenet, the second is to **provide solutions that are reliable and absolutely robust**.
Embedded devices must stay operational no matter what.
Failed updates, incompatible or inconsistent software, and improper state management run the risk of rendering devices inoperable in the field, causing major inconveniences for users and requiring costly in-the-field repairs.
Our aim is to **make it easy to follow best practices**, like read-only system partitions, fully atomic updates with on-device validation, and declarative, ideally fully reproducible builds.
**We will not sacrifice robustness and reliability for simplicity.**

The Rugix Project is driven by [Silitics](https://silitics.com), a for-profit company with a strong commitment to open source.
